## Ideas for this resource:

The IRC ML community is growing -- let's make this a really good ML resource. Together we can nudge it into shape from different angles.

I recommend organic growth -- not being overly hasty to overstructure too soon. That being said, each of these ideas probably wants its own folder + README.md.  GitHub allows relative links so it should be possible to keep everything tidy & build reusable structure.

* **Expand the channel topic here**

* **Reading group** (already started).  
  One idea might be for every talk to have its own folder, maybe containing source code + log transcript + {README.md linking to the arXiv paper & the above}.  

* **Getting started**  
  Rather than some big unhelpful list of links, maybe we can provide a path to actually getting the first bite on the bobapple.
  
* **Introduce ourselves**  
  Many of us have a homepage somewhere, it's good to see what people are working on.  

* **Detailing a birds eye view of the tree/web of contemporary ML**  
  http://deeplearningbook.org/  
  [On the Origin of Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07800)  
  etc.  
  Also linking to landmark papers & relevant blog posts, vids, GitHub repos etc.

* **Wiki-style breakdowns of various techniques e.g. VAEs**  
  Unfortunately GitHub doesn't render equations $a^2+b^2=fail$ (yet?).  

* **Comparison of available frameworks, IDEs, workflows**  
  TensorFlow, Keras, Matlab, Julia, etc.
