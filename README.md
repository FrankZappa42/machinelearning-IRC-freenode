# machinelearning-IRC-freenode
Community repo for the `##machinelearning` and `##ml-ot` IRC channels on Freenode 

[Reading Group](ReadingGroup/README.md)


The IRC ML community is growing -- let's make this a really good ML resource. Together we can nudge it into shape from different angles.

## Ideas for this resource:

* **Expand the channel topic here**

* **Getting started**  
  Rather than some big unhelpful list of links, maybe we can provide a path to actually getting the first bite on the bobapple.
  
* **Detailing a path towards getting a birds eye view of contemporary ML**  
  http://deeplearningbook.org/  
  [On the Origin of Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07800)  
  etc.  
  
* **Introduce ourselves**  
  Many of us have a homepage somewhere, it's good to see what people are working on.  

* **Reading group** (already started).  
  One idea might be for every talk to have its own folder, maybe containing source code + log transcript + {README.md linking to the arXiv paper & the above}.  

* **Wiki-style breakdowns of various techniques e.g. VAEs**  
  Unfortunately GitHub doesn't render equations $a^2+b^2=fail$ (yet?).
