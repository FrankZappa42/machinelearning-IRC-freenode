* **pi-** (Oxford UK, freelance coder, https://github.com/p-i-)  
  *ML Interests:* Primarily the theory. The new stuff as it comes out (GANs, VAEs, etc.), biologically plausible models (spiking neuron,...), coding in Julia.  
  *Relevant skills:* IPython / numpy, Matlab, Julia  
  My background is coding, math, DSP. I'm trying to get myself up to speed with modern ML thinking & get a grip on the probabilistic math. I'm keeping an eye on Julia. My goal is to become a digital nomad working with ML.

* **pasky** (Prague CZ, Github: https://github.com/pasky)  
  *ML Interests:* Deep architectures, attention models, transfer learning, practice rather than theory  
  In the past, I worked in academia and freelance on a variety of AI / machine learning problems. My main focus was Computer Go (my masters was one of the sort-of-AlphaGo-predecessor programs) and then NLP (question answering and related text understanding problems). Lately I do a lot of vision-like stuff - I co-founded an AI startup Rossum where we are reading invoices using neural networks. I'm a hardcore Keras fan.

* **brand0** (Washington, USA, Github: https://github.com/brandonrobertz)  
  *ML Interests:* character-level modeling, text clustering, outlier detection, application to journalism  
  I'm an independent researcher with professional experience in investigative journalism and publishing, machine learning, and full-stack development in the tech industry. Currently editing a zine exploring machine learning applied to journalism called [Artificial Informer](http://artificialinformer.com).

* **jo_** (California, USA, Researcher, https://github.com/josephcatrambone)  
  *ML Interests:* Generative Models, Production-Ready (End-User Distributable) Systems, Building ML Frameworks  
  *Relevant skills:* Python, Java, Kotlin, C, JavaScript, Rust  
  Started a PhD in ML.  Finished with an MS.  Not very good.  I'm interested in procedural content creation and generative machine learning models, particularly conversational chat bots and image generation.  I enjoy game development as a hobby and do my best to bring the two areas together whenever I can.
  
* **rofer** (Pittsburgh, USA, Software Engineer, https://github.com/rhofour)  
  *ML Interests:* Sample-efficient Deep RL methods, variational methods, generative models  
  Ever since I left undergrad I've been trying to work towards a graduate level understanding of ML methods while working fulltime. Right now I'm particularly interested in improving the sample efficiency of Q-learning methods.
