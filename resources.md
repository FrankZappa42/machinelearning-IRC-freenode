## Getting started
* [DeepLearning.TV YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjJh1vlSEYgvZ3ze_4pxKHNh1g5PId36-) -- 17 ~5-min vids, good starter -- introduces the main ideas at a non-technical level.
* [Andrew Ng's ML Coursera course](https://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=A89DCFA6ADACE599) -- best beginner course.
* [Nielsen -- Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html) -- online book, recommended for beginners.
* [Hinton's Coursera course: Neural Networks for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks) (Youtube playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoRl3Ht4JOcdU872GhiYWf6jwrk_SNhz9)) -- gets pretty advanced, and much of the later material is fast becoming obsolete (RBM, WakeSleep, DBM, DBN). Nevertheless Hinton is the single biggest contributor to modern ML, and it's worth persevering with.
