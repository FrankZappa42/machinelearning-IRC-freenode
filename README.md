# machinelearning-IRC-freenode
This is the community repo for the `##machinelearning` and `##ml-ot` IRC channels on [Freenode](https://freenode.net/).


## Links
* [Resources](resources.md) - machine learning resources
* [Reading Group](ReadingGroup/README.md) - discussion on alternate Sundays at 8pm GMT on a topic of our choosing

# Who are we?
[Here is a select list of users.](users.md) If you are contributing to the channel, please consider private-messaging *pi-* an introductory text (freestyle ok) & I'll add it here (or submit a PR). It would be nice if we have some idea of who is who, who is up to what, etc. Tell us where you are based (so we can figure out your time zone).  Are you using ML for work or play?  What do you use it for?  Do you have a github repo?  Are you at a company/uni?  Care to say?  etc.

# Ideas for this resource:

The IRC ML community is growing -- let's make this a really good ML resource. Together we can nudge it into shape from different angles.

I recommend organic growth -- not being overly hasty to overstructure too soon. That being said, each of these ideas probably wants its own folder + README.md.  GitHub allows relative links so it should be possible to keep everything tidy & build reusable structure.

* **Getting started**  
  Rather than some big unhelpful list of links, maybe we can provide a path to actually getting the first bite on the bobapple. (*underway*)
  
* **Introduce ourselves**  
  Many of us have a homepage somewhere, it's good to see what people are working on.  (*underway*)

* **Detailing a birds eye view of the tree/web of contemporary ML**  
  http://deeplearningbook.org/  
  [On the Origin of Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07800)  
  etc.  
  Also linking to landmark papers & relevant blog posts, vids, GitHub repos etc.

* **Wiki-style breakdowns of various techniques e.g. VAEs**  
  Unfortunately GitHub doesn't render equations $a^2+b^2=fail$ (yet?).  

* **Comparison of available frameworks, IDEs, workflows**  
  TensorFlow, Keras, Matlab, Julia, etc.
